    \section{Exercise 10.7.6}
    \begin{problem}
        Let $P: \N \to \{\blue, \orange\}$ be a sequence taking values in the set with exactly the two elements \blue\ and \orange.
        Assume that
        \begin{center}
            \parbox{\linewidth}{
                \leftskip=0.4\linewidth
                for all $k \in \N$, \\
                \hspace*{1em}there exists $m \ge k$, \\
                \hspace*{2em}$P_m = \blue$. \hfill (*)

            }
        \end{center}

        Show that there is a subsequence of $P: \N \to \{\blue, \orange\}$ for which every term equal \blue.%$by going through the following 
        % \begin{enumerate}
        %     \item Inductively define an index sequence $n: \N \to \N$ such that for all $k \in \N$, $P_{n_k} = \blue$.
        %         \begin{enumerate}
        %             \item First define $n_0 \in \N$ appropriately and prove that $CP_{n_0$
        %         \end{enumerate}
        % \end{enumerate}
    \end{problem}
    \begin{proof}
        We construct a index sequence $n: \N \to \N$ inductively such that for all $\ell \in \N$, $P_{n_\ell} = \blue$ and $n_\ell < n_{\ell+1}$.\\

        \noindent\textbf{Base step:} \\
        Choose $k = 0$ in (*), then there exists $m \ge 0$, such that $P_m = \blue$. \\
        Obtain such $m$. \\
        Set $n_0 = m$. \\

        \noindent\textbf{Inductive step:} \\
        Suppose we have defined $n_0,\dots,n_\ell$ for some $\ell \in \N$ \\
        such that $P_{n_0} = \blue,\dots,P_{n_\ell} = \blue$ and $n_0 < \dots < n_\ell$. \\
        Choose $k = n_\ell + 1$ in (*), then there exists $m \ge n_\ell + 1 > n_\ell$ such that $P_m = \blue$. \\
        Obtain such $m$. \\
        Choose $n_{\ell+1} = m$. \\
        Then $P_{n_{\ell+1}} = \blue$ and $n_{\ell+1} > n_\ell$. \\

        By induction, we have defined $n: \N \to \N$ such that for all $\ell \in \N$, $P_{n_\ell} = \blue$ and $n_\ell < n_{\ell+1}$. \\
        Then $P_{n_\ell} = \blue$ for all $\ell \in \N$. \\
    \end{proof}

    \section{Exercise 11.6.1}
    \begin{problem}
        Let $V, \norm{\cdot})$ be a normed linear space and let $A$ be the closed ball of radius $1$ aroudn the origin, i.e.
        $$A:=\{v \in V \mid \norm{v} \le 1\}.$$
        Show that the set $A$ is closed
    \end{problem}
    \begin{proof}
        Need to show that $A$ is closed, i.e. $V \setminus A$ is open. \\
    \end{proof}

    \section{Exercise 11.6.2}
    \begin{problem}
        Show that the interval $[0,1)$ is neither open nor closed (seen as a subset of the normed linear space $(\R, |\cdot|)$).
    \end{problem}

    \end{proof}

    \section{Exercise 11.6.4}
    \begin{problem}
        Consider the following line $\R^2$
        $$L:=\{(x,y) \in \R^2 \mid x+2y = 1\}.$$
        Show that $L$ is a closed subset of $\R^2$ and that $L$ is complete.
